Content Based Movie Recommendation System

**About**

This project is about building a content based movie recommendation system with a kaggle dataset

A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. Eg: In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or In the case of kindle which book to read, etc.

In this project, we will be exploring a specific type of recommendation system called the content based recommendation using python and pandas library. In this type of recommendation system with regards to movies, relevant movies are shown using the content of the previously searched movies by the users. 

**Project Summary**

During the course of buiding this project, I checked for 
- tidiness 
- quality
- performed data cleaning
- created new column for unique genre
- performed exploratory data analysis
- carried out one-hot encoding for categorical features
- created a user's profile that will feed the recommendation system
- Extracted the User's forechoices.
- leanred the User Profile via Matrix-Algebra.
- eventually build the content-based filtering that is fed with user's profile to predicted the next top 10 movies based on the user's profile
